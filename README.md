# USA-Crime-Statistics-K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering

## 1. Business Problem

The objective of this project is to segment U.S. states into different clusters based on their crime statistics. By clustering the states according to various crime metrics, law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and researchers can better understand crime patterns and tailor crime prevention strategies for each cluster.

### Task:
The main task is to apply **clustering algorithms** to classify the U.S. states into groups based on their crime statistics, which include **Murder numbers**, **Assault numbers**, **Urban Population numbers**, and **Rape numbers**.

## 2. Dataset Story

The dataset consists of crime statistics for various U.S. states. The variables represent different types of crimes and population-related metrics. The data includes murder and assault rates, the percentage of the urban population, and the rape rate for each state.

### 2.1 Variables:
- **Murder**: The number of murders.
- **Assault**: The number of assaults.
- **UrbanPop**: The percentage of the state's population living in urban areas.
- **Rape**: The number of rapes.

### Example Data:
| State      | Murder | Assault | UrbanPop | Rape |
|------------|--------|---------|----------|------|
| Alabama    | 13.2   | 236     | 58       | 21.2 |
| Alaska     | 10.0   | 263     | 48       | 44.5 |
| Arizona    | 8.1    | 294     | 80       | 31.0 |
| Arkansas   | 8.8    | 190     | 50       | 19.5 |
| California | 9.0    | 276     | 91       | 40.6 |

## 3. Objective

The primary goal of this project is to group states into clusters that share similar crime patterns. By applying **clustering techniques**, we aim to identify segments of states that can be analyzed to improve crime prevention strategies. The clustering will help in detecting patterns and similarities in crime across different states.

### Key Goals:
1. Utilize **clustering algorithms** such as **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** to segment the states.
2. Analyze the crime rates of each cluster to identify unique characteristics of each group.
3. Provide insights that could help stakeholders understand the nature of crime across the U.S.

## 4. Conclusion

The clustering of states based on crime data will help **policy makers** and **law enforcement agencies** better allocate resources and tailor crime prevention programs. By understanding the unique crime patterns of each cluster, these entities can craft strategies that are more effective in reducing crime rates and addressing state-specific crime concerns.
